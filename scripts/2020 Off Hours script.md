Thanks for tuning in!

Our synchronized light show will start at 6:30 and run until 9:00 each night.
We hope you can come back and view the full audio visual experience.
Happy Holidays!

Mostly the same as the the preshow but removed "We hope you enjoy the animated lights." as the lights are not on at all during the off hours
